# #CodeNewbie CSS Modal

This project is a *simple* modal example using **only** CSS and HTML. It uses CSS3 [`target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target) selector to enable the modal.

*This is the first of several projects that will come to help people who are starting to code. I want to make clear that I'm not an expert or anything, but I'll do my best to help people as much as I can with the knowledge I have.*

If you have any questions, suggestions, or if it helped you, please don't hesitate to mention or DM me on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mantoanrodrigo)**.


## Useful Tips (or things I consider useful tips haha)

### Code clean and add comments
Making commented code you help you not only learn more (because you're describing to yourself what you're doing), it will also help you and others read your code clearly and understand what you tried to do - in cases. You don't need to comment every line, but I recommend commenting things you're learning and complex functions, etc.

### Make buttons look clickable
When creating something that will be clickable, try to make it look as clickable as possible, avoid making buttons as plain texts with no effect or anything that shows it can be clickable. Simple :hover effect, some small shadow, color, anything that you think will make it look clickable.

I've created a "bad example" of the same page but a button that I think won't provide a good experience. You can check *[bad-button.html](/codenewbie-css_modal/bad-button.html)*.

### Emmet is helpful, use it!
I used (and often use) a lot of emmet ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), eg. `div.modal-call` > Press `[TAB]` > it will create a div with class `modal-call`.

I also use it to start the HTML doc - put `!` and press `[TAB]` and it will create the basic HTML tags:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

***But don't forget to practice how to do things manually, without emmet.***

### Practice as much as you can!
Practice makes you better, not only in code but anything in life. You may hear it a lot, but yeah, it's good advice. In a practical way, what I suggest is: try to take an old project and redo it using your current knowledge (even if it's a month-old project), try to make it better and cleaner.
